Torch autodiff DFT-D4
=====================

Implementation of the DFT-D4 dispersion model in PyTorch.
This module allows to process a single structure or a batch of structures for
the calculation of atom-resolved dispersion energies.

.. note::

   This project is still in early development and the API is subject to change.
   Contributions are welcome, please checkout our
